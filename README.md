# Welcome to Smeagol!
Smeagol is a hackable, extensible Wiki engine which is reasonably user-friendly. It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as its text format, and [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to provide versioning and backup.

**NOTE** Smeagol is no longer actively maintained; I have moved on to using [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) as my preferred system for generating websites. There's a lot of good ideas in Smeagol, but doing markdown to HTML conversion every time a document is requested puts load on the server which isn't really merited. If anyone else would like to take on the project, they would be welcome to do so.

## Using Smeagol
Read the [[User Documentation]] for an introduction to all Smeagol's features.

## Markup syntax
Smeagol uses the Markdown format as provided by [markdown-clj](https://github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj), with the addition that anything enclosed in double square brackets, \[\[like this\]\], will be treated as a link into the wiki itself. The markdown format is extensible, and has extensions already for inclusions, for data visualisations and for picture galleries. Read more about [[Extensible Markup]].

## Security and authentication
Smeagol now has good security and authentication. While the initial password supplied with the system is not encrypted, when it is changed it will be; and passwords for new users added through the user administration pages are encrypted. Read more about [[Security and authentication]].

## Internationalisation
Smeagol has built in internationalisation. Currently it has translation files for English, German, Lithuanian and Russian. We'd welcome volunteers to translate it into other languages.

## Images
You can (if you're logged in) upload files, including images, using the **Upload a file** link on the top menu bar. You can link to an uploaded image, or to other images already available on the web, like this:

![Smeagol](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/e/e1/Gollum_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20141218075509)

## Running Smeagol
You can run Smeagol from the [[Docker Image]]; alternatively you can run it from an executable jar file or as a war file in a servlet container. Read how about [[Configuring Smeagol]] and [[Deploying Smeagol]].

## Developing Smeagol
Smeagol is an open source project; you're entitled to make changes yourself. Read more about  [[Developing Smeagol]].

## Phoning home
Smeagol does currently fetch one image from my home site. Read more about [[Phoning Home]], and how to prevent it (if you want to).
